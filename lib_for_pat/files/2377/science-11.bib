abstract = "Abstract Previous neuroimaging research has established that the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) is involved in long-term memory (LTM) encoding for individual items. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is implicated less frequently, and one theory that has gained support to explain this discrepancy is that \{DLPFC\} is involved in forming item-item relational but not item LTM. Given that neuroimaging results are correlational, complimentary methods such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have been used to test causal hypotheses generated from imaging data. Most \{TMS\} studies of \{LTM\} encoding have found that disruption of lateral \{PFC\} activity impairs subsequent memory. However these studies have lacked methods to precisely localize and directly compare \{TMS\} effects from frontal subregions implicated by the neuroimaging literature. Here, we target specific subregions of lateral \{PFC\} with \{TMS\} to test the prediction from the item/relational framework that temporary disruption of \{VLPFC\} during encoding will impair subsequent memory whereas \{TMS\} to \{DLPFC\} during item encoding will not. Frontal \{TMS\} was administered prior to a \{LTM\} encoding task in which participants were presented with a list of individual nouns and asked to judge whether each noun was concrete or abstract. After a 40&#xa0;min delay period, item recognition memory was tested. Results indicate that \{VLPFC\} and \{DLPFC\} \{TMS\} have differential effects on subsequent item memory. \{VLPFC\} \{TMS\} reliably disrupted subsequent item memory whereas \{DLPFC\} \{TMS\} led to numerical enhancement in item memory, relative to \{TMS\} to a control region.
