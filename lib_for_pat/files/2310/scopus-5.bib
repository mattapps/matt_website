abstract={Two studies (n = 273 and 254) used self-determination theory (SDT) to examine unemployed people 's motivation both to search and not to search for a job. The self-regulation questionnaire format (Ryan & Connell, 1989) was used to assess participants' autonomous and controlled job-search motivation (the 'why ' of job search) as well as their amotivation for searching. Additionally, both autonomous and controlled motivation for not searching (the 'why not ' of job search) was assessed. Results provide validity for these five motivational constructs and indicate, in line with SDT, that the constructs predicted reports of search behaviour, affective experiences, and well-being. The addition of autonomous and controlled motivation for not searching contributed additional predictive power beyond the motivational constructs that focused only on searching.
