abstract = "The psychometric properties of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) were evaluated in a normal sample of N = 717 who were also administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The \{DASS\} was shown to possess satisfactory psychometric properties, and the factor structure was substantiated both by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. In comparison to the \{BDI\} and BAI, the \{DASS\} scales showed greater separation in factor loadings. The \{DASS\} Anxiety scale correlated 0.81 with the BAI, and the \{DASS\} Depression scale correlated 0.74 with the BDI. Factor analyses suggested that the \{BDI\} differs from the \{DASS\} Depression scale primarily in that the \{BDI\} includes items such as weight loss, insomnia, somatic preoccupation and irritability, which fail to discriminate between depression and other affective states. The factor structure of the combined \{BDI\} and \{BAI\} items was virtually identical to that reported by Beck for a sample of diagnosed depressed and anxious patients, supporting the view that these clinical states are more severe expressions of the same states that may be discerned in normals. Implications of the results for the conceptualisation of depression, anxiety and tension/stress are considered, and the utility of the \{DASS\} scales in discriminating between these constructs is discussed.
