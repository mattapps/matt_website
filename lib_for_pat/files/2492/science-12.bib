abstract = "Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is traditionally conceptualised as a disorder of movement, but recent data suggest that motivational deficits may be more pervasive than previously thought. Here, we ask whether subclinical deficits in incentivised decision-making are present in \{PD\} and, if so, whether dopaminergic therapy ameliorates such deficits. We devised a novel paradigm in which participants decided whether they were willing to squeeze a hand-held dynamometer at varying levels of force for different magnitudes of reward. For each participant, we estimated the effort level at which the probability of accepting a reward was 50% – the effort ‘indifference point’. Patients with \{PD\} (N = 26) were tested \{ON\} and \{OFF\} their usual dopaminergic medication, and their performance compared to those of age-matched controls (N = 26). No participant was clinically apathetic as defined by the Lille Apathy Rating Scale. Our data show that, regardless of medication status, patients with \{PD\} chose to engage less effort than controls for the lowest reward. Overall, however, dopamine had a motivating effect on participants’ choice behaviour – patients with \{PD\} chose to invest more effort for a given reward when they were in the \{ON\} relative to \{OFF\} dopamine state. Importantly, this effect could not be attributed to motor facilitation. We conclude that deficits in incentivised decision-making are present in \{PD\} even in the absence of a clinical syndrome of apathy when rewards are low, but that dopamine acts to eliminate motivational deficits by promoting the allocation of effort.
